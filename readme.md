To play the game normally, just cd to the Checkers folder and type "ruby game.rb"

To try the Dispell version (that's broken) cd to the Modded folder and type "ruby dispel.rb"
TODO: Dispell version needs a moves list returned from the piece to validate moves properly.

This was part of my coursework when I attended App Academy.
